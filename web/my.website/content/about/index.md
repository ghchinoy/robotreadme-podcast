Robot Read Me reads release notes, so you don't have to.

Robot Read Me is in early access preview. 

The current features are:

* Audio content creation for a podcast. Specifically, a GCP Release Notes podcast.
* A podcast feed for the [GCP Release Notes](https://cloud.google.com/release-notes). For more info see the post entitled "[Podcast Feed Available](/posts/podcast_available/)".

Upcoming features are:
